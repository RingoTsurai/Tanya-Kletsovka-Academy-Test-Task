Hello, my name is Tatyana. Now I am aspiring to become a Java developer. 

I was very interested in your courses, as well as the opportunity after finishing them to apply the acquired skills in your company.

Before that, I had already studied in courses, and also studied independently. It will be very interesting for me to work in a team and apply Spring in my work.

I currently work as a 2/2 seller and I can spend 4/8 hours for training and quit my current job later. 

My level of English is around Pre-Intermediate - Intermediate and I continue to improve my knowledge.

I worked with many Java modules, and also used SQL in my project.

I hope you are satisfied with how I completed the test task and we can continue our communication at a technical interview.
